1.FCFS (First Come First Serve)
              -Jobs are executed on first come, first serve basis.
              -It is a non-preemptive, pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.
              -Easy to understand and implement.
              -Its implementation is based on FIFO queue.
              -Poor in performance as average wait time is high.

2.Shortest Job First
              -This is a non-preemptive, pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.
              -Best approach to minimize waiting time.
              -Easy to implement in Batch systems where required CPU time is known in advance.
              -Impossible to implement in interactive systems where required CPU time is not known.
              -The processer should know in advance how much time process will take.

3.Shortest Remaining Time 
              -Shortest remaining time (SRT) is the preemptive version of the SJF algorithm.
              -The processor is allocated to the job closest to completion but it can be preempted by a newer ready job with shorter time to completion.
              -Impossible to implement in interactive systems where required CPU time is not known.
              -It is often used in batch environments where short jobs need to give preference.

4.Round Robin
              -Round Robin is the preemptive process scheduling algorithm.
              -Each process is provided a fix time to execute, it is called a quantum.
              -Once a process is executed for a given time period, it is preempted and other process executes for a given time period.
              -Context switching is used to save states of preempted processes.

5.Priority Scheduling
              -Priority scheduling is a non-preemptive algorithm and one of the most common scheduling algorithms in batch systems.
              -Each process is assigned a priority. Process with highest priority is to be executed first and so on.
              -Processes with same priority are executed on first come first served basis.
              -Priority can be decided based on memory requirements, time requirements or any other resource requirement.
