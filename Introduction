Multilevel Queue Scheduling Algorithms

Multi-level queue scheduling algorithm is used in scenarios where the processes can be classified into groups
based on property like process type, CPU time, IO access, memory size, etc. In a multi-level queue scheduling
algorithm, there will be 'n' number of queues, where 'n' is the number of groups the processes are classified
into. Each queue will be assigned a priority and will have its own scheduling algorithm like round-robin
scheduling or FCFS. For the process in a queue to execute, all the queues of priority higher than it should be
empty, meaning the process in those high priority queues should have completed its execution. In this
scheduling algorithm, once assigned to a queue, the process will not move to any other queues.
